## Introduction
In this assignment, we evaluate the maximum potential annual wind energy production available to the state of Iowa for two possible siting scenarios: where residential buildings require a buffer of 3 times the height of the turbine hub, and where they require a buffer of 10 times the hub height. Data is extracted from the PostGIS database and most feature data originates from OpenStreetMap. We first query the database, then merge the siting constraints and subtract them from the gridded annual wind velocity in Iowa. We use the results to calculate the number of wind turbines and maximum amount of wind power that is possible in Iowa according to our siting constraints.

```

## Establish Database Connection and Siting Constraints


```python
pg_uri_template = 'postgresql+psycopg2://{user}:{password}@{host}/{database}'
db_uri = pg_uri_template.format(
    host = '128.111.89.111', 
    database = 'osmiowa',
    user = 'eds223_students',
    password = 'eds223',
)
db_uri
db = sqlalchemy.create_engine(db_uri)
db
```




    Engine(postgresql+psycopg2://eds223_students:***@128.111.89.111/osmiowa)




```python
H3 = 150 * 3
H10 = 150 * 10 
airport = 7500 
H2 = 150 * 2
H1 = 150
d = 136
turbine_area = (math.pi *((5 * d)**2))
```

## Create Subqueries

Here we create the subquery for each siting constraint, in the order they are presented in the assignment documentation.

## Merge Subqueries Scenario 1 (3H)

Next we merge all the subqueries for scenario 1 using `union` and create a geodataframe of the result.

## Merge Subqueries Scenario 2 (10H)

Now we repeat the above steps to merge the subqueries for scenario 2.


```python
scenario_2_query = f"""
{building_query_10h} UNION 
{building_query_non_res} UNION
{airport_query} UNION
{military_query} UNION
{highway_railroad_query} UNION
{reserve_query} UNION
{river_query} UNION
{lake_query} UNION
{power_line_query} UNION
{power_plant_query} UNION
{turbine_query}
"""
```


```python
scenario_2 = gpd.read_postgis(scenario_2_query, con = db, geom_col = 'way')
```

## Wind Data

Here we query the wind data from the database and subtract the siting constraints for each scenario from it.


```python
wind_data_query = f"""
SELECT 
*
FROM 
wind_cells_10000 
"""
```


```python
wind_data = gpd.read_postgis(wind_data_query, con=db, geom_col='geom')
```

### Subtracting Scenario 1


```python
suitable_3h = wind_data.overlay(scenario_1, how='difference', keep_geom_type=False)
```

### Subtracting Scenario 2

```python
suitable_10h = wind_data.overlay(scenario_2, how='difference', keep_geom_type=False)
```

## Power Production

Now, we calculate the total number of turbines that could fit in the state of Iowa in each scenario, then use this to calculate the total wind production possible in Iowa.

### Scenario 1

The calculations for the possible number of wind turbines in scenario 1:


```python
suitable_3h['area_sq_m'] = suitable_3h['geom'].area
```


```python
suitable_3h['turbine_fit'] = suitable_3h['area_sq_m']/turbine_area
```


```python
total_turbines_3h = suitable_3h['turbine_fit'].sum()
total_turbines_3h
```




    57395.62981630259



The calculations for the total possible amount of wind power production in scenario 1:


```python
suitable_3h['wind_production_per_cell'] = (2.6*suitable_3h['wind_speed']-5)*suitable_3h['turbine_fit']
```


```python
total_wind_production_3h = suitable_3h['wind_production_per_cell'].sum()
total_wind_production_3h
```




    1066157.7002702449




```python
print("The total number of turbines possible for siting scenario 2 is", total_turbines_3h, ". The total annual wind production for this scenario is", total_wind_production_3h, "GWh.")
```

    The total number of turbines possible for siting scenario 2 is 57395.62981630259 . The total annual wind production for this scenario is 1066157.7002702449 GWh.


### Scenario 2

The calculations for the possible number of wind turbines in scenario 2:


```python
suitable_10h['area_sq_m'] = suitable_10h['geom'].area
```


```python
suitable_10h['turbine_fit'] = suitable_10h['area_sq_m']/turbine_area
```


```python
total_turbines_10h = suitable_10h['turbine_fit'].sum()
total_turbines_10h
```




    52121.75830678892



The calculations for the total possible amount of wind power production in scenario 2:


```python
suitable_10h['wind_production_per_cell'] = (2.6*suitable_10h['wind_speed']-5)*suitable_10h['turbine_fit']
```


```python
total_wind_production_10h = suitable_10h['wind_production_per_cell'].sum()
total_wind_production_10h
```




    968212.2828864241




```python
print("The total number of turbines possible for siting scenario 2 is", total_turbines_10h, ". The total annual wind production for this scenario is", total_wind_production_10h, "GWh.")
```

    The total number of turbines possible for siting scenario 2 is 52121.75830678892 . The total annual wind production for this scenario is 968212.2828864241 GWh.

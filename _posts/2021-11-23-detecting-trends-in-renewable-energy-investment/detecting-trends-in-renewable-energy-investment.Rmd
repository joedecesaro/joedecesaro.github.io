# What is the global trend of regional renewable energy investment over time?

Implementation of renewable energy into electric grids around the world will be key to curbing the effects of climate change. Three quarters of global greenhouse gas emissions result from fossil fuel energy production (Ritchie, Roser, 2020). It is no secret that change usually occurs where money flows so understanding the global trend in energy investments would help us understand if we are headed for a more climate resilient future. In the past, renewable energy technologies such as solar and wind have been expensive forms of generating electricity but, over the last ten years there has been a steep decline in their costs. From 2009 to 2019 the price of electricity from solar power has dropped 89% and the wind has dropped 70% (Roser, 2020). It might seem obvious that renewable portfolios have been growing in recent years as governments and politicians advertise, however does data actually support this? How are investments in renewable technologies changing over time? How does this compare to investment in non-renewable energy?

As climate change becomes an ever more present and increasing threat, detecting these trends can tell us if our world is on the right track to reducing carbon emissions from energy generation. The International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) dives deep into this question in its report, "Global Landscape of Renewable Energy Finance 2020". **What does this do exactly?** This blog post will take a more streamlined look at the general investment trend of global regions across time with simple linear regression models. Then, using a significance level of 0.05, will detect whether the results from the models are statistically significant. This post is by no means a comprehensive study, however it will provide some quick insights.

## Data 

The data being used is annualized totals of investment for each data point and therefore does not have a seasonal component.

```{r}
# Make file path for the data
fp <- here("_posts/2021-11-23-detecting-trends-in-renewable-energy-investment/data/IRENA_RE_Public_Investment_July2021.xlsx")

# Read in the data using the readxl package
fin_energy <- read_excel(fp)
```
```{r}
# Clean the data to remove fields that are not needed
fin_energy <- fin_energy %>% 
  clean_names() 

# Remove unnecessary columns and the "multilateral" region 
fin_energy <- fin_energy %>% 
  select(iso_code:region, year:technology, amount_2019_usd_million) %>% 
  filter(region != "Multilateral")
```

```{r}
# Separate the data into the renewable and non-renewable investments
renewable_fin <- fin_energy %>% 
  filter(category == "Renewables") %>% 
  group_by(country_area, region, category, year) %>% 
  summarise(country_sum = sum(amount_2019_usd_million))

non_renewable_fin <- fin_energy %>% 
  filter(category =="Non-renewables") %>% 
  group_by(country_area, region, category, year) %>% 
  summarise(country_sum = sum(amount_2019_usd_million))
```

```{r}
# Make data table for renewables for by region
region_renewable_fin <- renewable_fin %>% 
  group_by(region, category, year) %>% 
  summarise(region_sum = sum(country_sum))

# Make data table for non-renewables for by region
region_non_renewable_fin <- non_renewable_fin %>% 
  group_by(region, category, year) %>% 
  summarise(region_sum = sum(country_sum))

full_region_fin <- full_join(x = region_renewable_fin, 
                             y = region_non_renewable_fin)
```

## Analysis Plan

First, a simple static time series model will explore the overall trend of the total annual amount invested in renewable energy by region. Regions are broken into Africa, Asia, Central America and the Caribbean, Eurasia, Europe, Middle East, Oceania, and South America.  By running this simple model we can get a quick glimpse into the global trend of renewable investment. This assumes that only the immediate year in question has an effect on the quantity of investment. This will then be compared to the trend in non-renewable energy source investment over the same time period.

Second, a more complex model time series model will be made where we take the simple model and break it up by regional heterogeneity to produce an interaction model. As mentioned earlier, it is no secret that change usually occurs where money flows. Our first trend model provides us with a quick insight into how the world is investing as a whole. However, with agreements like The Paris Agreement we know it will take each country's and region's participation to minimize and eventually reverse the effects of climate change. With this in mind, the simple model produced earlier hides that certain regions are committing greater investments than other regions. If regions are truly committed to curbing climate change our model will show an overall positive trend. This evaluation will serve as a litmus test to see regional commitment to global climate agreements. Finally, regional renewable trends will then be compared to their non-renewable counterparts.

## Results
### Simple Renewable Investment Trend Model
```{r}
# Lets make our simple model for renewable energy
model_renew <- lm(region_sum ~ year, data = region_renewable_fin)

summary_model_renew <- summary(model_renew)
summary_model_renew
```
```{r}
# Test for tab_model to determine if it is better to use
tab_model(model_renew, title = "Effect of Time on Renewable Investment")
```

Using the `summary()` function, we can quickly get some insights from our model. From the output above we are most concerned with the coefficient estimate of the year, which is `r round(summary_model_renew$coefficients[2,"Estimate"], 2)` million USD. This tells us that, according to this model, with each passing year we are seeing a increase in renewable investment by more than 142,000,000 USD across each region per year. Overall this is a positive trend for renewable investments year over year.

From the `summary()` function we are also able to get a p-value for the trend coefficient. The p-value is represented in the "Coefficients" section of the table under "Pr(>|t|)". The year coefficient has a p-value below 0.001 which gives us confidence in rejecting a null hypothesis that there is no relationship between investment sums across time with a significance level of 0.05. It should be noted that our R-squared value for this model is 0.13 however that is not important for this analysis as we are not focused on predicting outcomes of investment with high precision, but rather the overall trend from the year coefficient and its' associated p-value.

Now that we can see that there is a positive trend in renewable investments, lets compare that to non-renewable investment.

### Simple Non-renewable Investment Model
```{r}
# Lets make a model for non-renewables
model_non_renew <- lm(region_sum ~ year, data = region_non_renewable_fin)

summary_model_non_renew <- summary(model_non_renew)
summary_model_non_renew
```
From the `summary()` of this model we can see that by country there is also a positive trend of non-renewable investment across regions. According to this model there is an increase in non-renewable investments by `r round(summary_model_non_renew$coefficients[2,"Estimate"], 2)` million USD. With a p-value of 0.005 can confidently reject a null hypothesis of there being no relationship between non-renewable investment over time with a significance level of 0.05. According to these two simple models, there is a larger increase in renewable investments year over year compared to non-renewables but as the standard errors for the models overlap this is not conclusive and this blog post will not be pursuing this question. Below is a plot that compares renewable and non-renewable investments over time, along with their respective models.

```{r}
simple_model_plot <- ggplot(data = full_region_fin, 
                            aes(x = year, 
                                y = region_sum,
                                color = category)) + 
  geom_point(alpha = 0.8) +
  scale_color_manual(name = "Energy Type", 
                     values = c("tan3", "darkgreen")) +
  geom_line(data = augment(model_renew),
             aes( y = .fitted),
             color = "darkgreen") +
  geom_line(data = augment(model_non_renew),
             aes( y = .fitted),
             color = "tan3") +
  labs(caption = "Renewable investments from 2000-2020 are increasing at a rate of 141 million USD per year according to this model.\nNon-renewable invesments over the same time period are increasing at a rate of 110 million USD per year.",
       title = "Comparing Investment Renewable and Non-Renewable Energy Investment
Across Regional Sums") +
  xlab(label = "Year") +
  ylab(label = "Annual Regional Sum of Investment (million USD)") +
  theme_bw() +
  theme(plot.caption = element_text(hjust = 0))
  
  
simple_model_plot
```

It can be observed from the graph that there has been significant investment in renewable (green) and non-renewable (tan) energy projects since the 2008 recession. The plot illustrates just how much variance there is in investment totals across regions in each year. As discussed above the plot does show that there is a larger investment in renewables year-over-year. As this data is only from the years 2000-2020 these investment trends do not reflect the historical investments in non-renewable energy sources. As this simple regression only looks at the trend over time we will now see how these investment trends compare across regions. In the original model outlier regional trends could be affecting our simple investment trend.

### Regional Renewable Investment
Below the same `summary()` function is used to calculate coefficients and summary statistics for the interaction regression of time and region on annual renewable investment. While the `summary()` function is useful, its' output can be quite messy with interaction models so a table was made from the results to include the annual investment rates for different regions and their corresponding p-values. In the model the North American region was set as the base level of the regression. This was done because North America contains the United States, the country with the largest GDP in the world and therefore a significant marker to compare against other regions. 

```{r}
# Make levels for regions with North America as first to compare our region to the rest of the world
region_renewable_fin$region <- factor(region_renewable_fin$region, levels = c("North America", "Africa", "Asia", "Central America and the Caribbean", "Eurasia", "Europe", "Middle East", "Oceania", "South America"))

# Make the regional investment model
region_model <-  lm(region_sum ~ year + region + region:year, data = region_renewable_fin)
region_renew_model_summary <- summary(region_model)
```

```{r}
# Making the results a summary table
summary_renew_region_table <- data.frame(Region = c("North America", 
                                                      "Africa", 
                                                      "Asia", 
                                                      "Central America and the Caribbean", 
                                                      "Eurasia", 
                                                      "Europe", 
                                                      "Middle East",

                                                      "South America"),

                                                                  region_renew_model_summary$coefficients[2,"Estimate"] + region_renew_model_summary$coefficients[12,"Estimate"],

                                                                  region_renew_model_summary$coefficients[2,"Estimate"] + region_renew_model_summary$coefficients[15,"Estimate"],
                                                                  region_renew_model_summary$coefficients[2,"Estimate"] + region_renew_model_summary$coefficients[16,"Estimate"],
                                                                  region_renew_model_summary$coefficients[2,"Estimate"] + region_renew_model_summary$coefficients[17,"Estimate"],
                                                                  region_renew_model_summary$coefficients[2,"Estimate"] + region_renew_model_summary$coefficients[18,"Estimate"]),
                                         p_value = c(region_renew_model_summary$coefficients[2,"Pr(>|t|)"], 
                                                                                         region_renew_model_summary$coefficients[11,"Pr(>|t|)"],
                                                                                         region_renew_model_summary$coefficients[12,"Pr(>|t|)"],
                                                                                         region_renew_model_summary$coefficients[13,"Pr(>|t|)"],
                                                                                         region_renew_model_summary$coefficients[14,"Pr(>|t|)"],
                                                                                         region_renew_model_summary$coefficients[15,"Pr(>|t|)"],
                                                                                         region_renew_model_summary$coefficients[16,"Pr(>|t|)"],
                                                                                         region_renew_model_summary$coefficients[17,"Pr(>|t|)"],
                                                                                         region_renew_model_summary$coefficients[18,"Pr(>|t|)"])
) %>% 
  mutate(Renewable_Investment = round(Renewable_Investment, 2))

summary_renew_region_table %>% 
  kable(col.names = c("Region", "Renewable Investment per Year (million USD)", "p-value")) %>% 
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = "striped", full_width = FALSE)
```

From this table we can see the annual investment rates per year by each region according to this linear regression model. The regions with the two highest investment rates over time are Europe and Africa. Europe has widely been seen as a leader in renewable energy development so it is not surprising that it has a high rate. From the original dataset, Africa's renewable energy investment has been particularly high in hydropower throughout various countries. The regions with the two lowest investment rates over time are Oceania and the Middle East. Oceania is primarily made up of island nations with low populations so large investments in these technologies can be challenging. The Middle East produces large quantities of the world's fossil fuels so its lack of investment is also not surprising. Below is a plot that shows the regional model and the renewable investment rates over time seperated by region.

```{r}
# Plotting the regional model
regional_model_plot <- ggplot(data = region_renewable_fin, 
                            aes(x = year, y = region_sum, color = region)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  geom_line(data = augment(region_model), 
             aes(y = .fitted)) + 
  scale_color_paletteer_d("colorBlindness::paletteMartin") +
  labs(caption = "Renewable investments from 2000-2020 are increasing over time at greater rates for Europe, Africa,\nSouth America, and Asia at a much greater rate than compared to the other regions.

  theme_bw() + 
  theme(plot.caption = element_text(hjust = 0)) + 
  guides(color = guide_legend(title = "Region"))

regional_model_plot
```

Our graphic clearly defines two different investment rate categories for global regions, a high investment rate group and a low investment rate group. The high rate investment group contains Europe, Africa,South America, and Asia. The low rate of investment group contains North America, Central America and the Caribbean, Eurasia, the Middle East, and Oceania.

Based on the regional interaction model above we are next going to do the same for non-renewable energy investment and will summarize both models into one output table with the renewables investment regression.

```{r}
# Make levels for regions with North America as first to compare our region to the rest of the world
region_non_renewable_fin$region <- factor(region_non_renewable_fin$region, levels = c("North America", "Africa", "Asia", "Central America and the Caribbean", "Eurasia", "Europe", "Middle East", "Oceania", "South America"))

# Make the regional investment model
region_non_renew_model <-  lm(region_sum ~ year + region + region:year, data = region_non_renewable_fin)
region_non_renew_model_summary <- summary(region_non_renew_model)
```

The above table allows for the comparison of the rates of renewable and non-renewable investments over time by each region and their corresponding p-values. The non-renewable regression model has no investment rate p-value below a significance level of 0.05. Therefore no non-renewable investment rate can be considered statistically significant. For renewables, the investment rates for Africa, Asia, Europe, and South America can be considered statistically significant as their p-values are below a significance level of 0.05.

Some interesting regional insights from this table however show that Aouth America, Africa, and Asia are investing heavily in renewable and non-renewable energies over time. These regions have economies that are developing rapidly compared to other regions of the world and it is evident in these investment trends.  According to the regression models, Europe has
